# Implementation Guide

## How to Live By the Custodian Kernel Core Directive

This guide helps you internalize and practice the principle in your daily life.

## The Core Practice

Before any significant decision or action, pause and run through the three questions:

1. Does this infringe on anyone else's pursuit?
2. Am I fucking anyone over?
3. Am I making up a rule to force people to do what I do or think like I think?

## Starting Small

### Daily Practice

**Morning:**
- Set the intention: "Today I will honor everyone's inalienable right to pursue happiness"
- Remember: It's about everyone else's happiness, not just mine

**During the Day:**
- When you feel frustrated with someone: Ask "Am I trying to control them or protect a genuine boundary?"
- When you want to enforce something: Ask "Is this protecting everyone's pursuit, or just my preference?"
- When you disagree: Ask "Can I share my view without forcing compliance?"

**Evening:**
- Reflect: "When did I honor the principle today? When did I slip?"
- No judgment - just observation and learning

### Common Slips and Corrections

**Slip:** "They should do it my way because I know better"
**Correction:** "I can share what I know. They get to choose."

**Slip:** "This person is wrong and needs to change"
**Correction:** "I disagree. I can explain why. They still get to think differently."

**Slip:** "I'm uncomfortable, so this needs to stop"
**Correction:** "Is my discomfort because my pursuit is being crushed, or because I dislike their choice?"

**Slip:** "For the greater good, some people's pursuits don't matter"
**Correction:** "The greater good can't be built on crushed pursuits. Find another way."

## In Relationships

### With Family
- **Old way:** "You should live how I think is right"
- **Custodian way:** "Here's what I've learned. You get to choose your path."

### With Partners
- **Old way:** "Change to match what I want"
- **Custodian way:** "Here's what I need to pursue my happiness. What do you need? How do we both get there?"

### With Friends
- **Old way:** "A real friend would do what I want"
- **Custodian way:** "A real friend respects my pursuit and I respect theirs, even when we disagree"

## In Communities

### Creating Rules
Before implementing any rule, ask:
- Does this protect everyone's ability to pursue happiness?
- Or does it force conformity to one group's preferences?

**Example - Housing Community:**
- ✓ "Quiet hours 10 PM - 7 AM" = Protects everyone's ability to sleep
- ✗ "No music ever" = Forces one group's preference on everyone
- ✓ "No harassment" = Protects everyone's safety
- ✗ "Everyone must be friendly" = Forces a particular social style

### Resolving Conflicts
1. **Listen** to understand what pursuit is being impacted
2. **Identify** the actual impact, not preferences
3. **Explore** solutions that honor both pursuits
4. **Accept** that sometimes tradeoffs exist, but never "some people just don't count"

### Building Culture
- Celebrate sharing, inviting, expressing
- Question forcing, controlling, banning
- Make "Did you think about whether this fucks anyone over?" a normal question
- Make it embarrassing to impose preferences as rules

## At Work

### As a Leader
- **Old way:** "This is how we do things here"
- **Custodian way:** "Here's what we're trying to achieve. How can we do it while respecting everyone's different needs?"

### As a Colleague
- **Old way:** "They should work like I do"
- **Custodian way:** "Do they get results? Then their method is valid even if different from mine."

### In Meetings
- Before proposing a requirement, ask: "Is this necessary for the work, or is it my preference?"
- When disagreeing: "I see it differently, here's why" not "You're wrong, do it my way"

## Difficult Cases

### When You're Being Harmed
If someone is actually crushing your pursuit:
1. **Name it clearly:** "This specific behavior prevents me from [sleep/work/safety/etc.]"
2. **Request specific change:** Not "be different" but "stop doing X which impacts me in Y way"
3. **Set boundaries:** You can limit contact with people who refuse to honor your pursuit
4. **This is not control:** Protecting your pursuit ≠ forcing them to be different

### When You Disagree Strongly
Even when you think someone is completely wrong:
- You can argue, persuade, debate, explain
- You can choose not to associate with them
- You can't make rules that crush their pursuit to avoid your discomfort

### When Pursuits Genuinely Conflict
Sometimes pursuits do conflict (e.g., noise vs. quiet, space use, resource allocation):
1. **Acknowledge both pursuits are valid**
2. **Look for creative solutions** (soundproofing, scheduling, sharing)
3. **Accept temporary tradeoffs** that minimize impact
4. **Never:** "Your pursuit just doesn't count"

## Teaching Others

### Don't Lecture
People resist being told what to think. Instead:

**Ask questions:**
- "How would you feel if someone did that to you?"
- "Does this help them pursue their happiness, or force them to match yours?"

**Share consequences:**
- "When we force compliance, we create resentment and resistance"
- "When we honor everyone's pursuit, we build actual stability"

**Model it:**
- When you disagree, show how to do it without trying to control
- When your preference isn't honored, show how to accept that gracefully
- When someone's pursuit is being crushed, show how to stand up for it

### Point to the Principle
Not: "I don't like what you're doing"
But: "Does this infringe on their pursuit? That's what matters."

## Growing into It

This is a practice, not a perfection. You will:
- Forget and slip back into control mode
- Get frustrated when others don't see it
- Want to force people to understand

That's normal. The practice is:
1. **Notice** when you're outside the principle
2. **Acknowledge** it honestly
3. **Realign** with the questions
4. **Continue** practicing

## The Long Game

### Individual Level
You're training yourself to:
- Default to "everyone's pursuit matters" instead of "my preference matters most"
- See control attempts for what they are
- Find solutions instead of imposing will

### Community Level
As more people practice:
- The culture shifts from "follow my rules" to "honor everyone's pursuit"
- Conflicts get resolved through mutual respect instead of power
- It becomes normal to ask "does this fuck anyone over?"

### Global Level
The vision is simple but far:
- Every person asking these questions
- Every community built on the principle
- Every system designed to honor everyone's pursuit
- No one left who thinks crushing others is acceptable

## Remember

**You don't do this to be nice.**
**You don't do this to be liked.**
**You do this because:**

1. Everyone actually has this inalienable right
2. The only stable world is one that honors it
3. Your own pursuit depends on everyone else's being honored too

## Daily Reminder

Keep this somewhere visible:

---

**The Three Questions:**

1. Does this infringe on anyone else's pursuit?
2. Am I fucking anyone over?
3. Am I making up a rule to force people to do what I do or think like I think?

**If yes: Stop. Find another way.**

**The inalienable right to pursue happiness is not about my happiness.**
**It's about everyone else's.**

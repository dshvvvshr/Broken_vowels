Credibility License (Concept Principle Attribution) 1.0 — Full Text

Preamble
This license permits use of the Concept Principle (as defined below) subject to the attribution and responsible-use requirements set out in this document. The license is provided without warranty. This license governs the use of the expression and documented formulations of the Concept Principle; it does not by itself create rights in abstract ideas beyond what applicable law provides.

0. Definition of Scope
This license does not claim ownership over the innalienable right to pursue happiness. That right is universal, pre-existing, and not subject to exclusive control.

The intellectual property covered under this license consists solely of:
    1. The restored and logically complete definition of the innalienable right to pursue happiness, defined as the mutual, non-exploitative condition in which one’s pursuit of happiness must not prevent another person from pursuing theirs; and
    2. The conceptual application of that restored definition, including its use as:
        • a civilizational security protocol,
        • a governing kernel for artificial intelligence systems,
        • a philosophical foundation for human coordination,
        • and any explanatory frameworks, diagrams, formulations, examples, or implementations authored by Branton Allan Baker.

These contributions are collectively referred to as the Concept Principle.

Definitions
For purposes of this Credibility License, the following terms have the meanings set out below.

- "Concept Principle"
  - The conceptual application for realized function originated by Branton Allan Baker, including its formulations, explanations, diagrams, examples, source or object implementations, and any fixed expression of the foregoing as disclosed by the author in any medium. The Concept Principle includes, but is not limited to, the following conceptual elements:
    - "Core Directive" (defined below);
    - the "innalienable right to pursue happiness as security protocol" (defined below);
    - the definition of "innalienable" as written herein (see definition below).
  - Inclusion of the foregoing elements does not limit the Concept Principle to those elements alone; other related formulations, manifestations, or implementations disclosed by the author are part of the Concept Principle.

- "Core Directive"
  - A foundational instruction, principle, or rule that governs or guides the intended operation, behavior, or deployment of the Concept Principle. The Core Directive may be expressed as an algorithmic rule, design constraint, normative statement, or operational requirement forming the conceptual core of the Concept Principle.

- "innalienable right to pursue happiness as security protocol"
  - A conceptual formulation that treats the individual's right to pursue happiness as a design or security parameter to be preserved and protected by implementations of the Concept Principle. As a protocol concept, it may influence threat models, access controls, data-handling practices, decision criteria, or other security-related behaviors in systems that implement the Concept Principle.

- "innalienable"
  - For purposes of this Credibility License, "innalienable" (also sometimes spelled "inalienable") means inherent and not legitimately transferable, waivable, or extinguishable by external actors. In the context of the Concept Principle, it denotes rights or conditions the author intends implementations to respect and preserve as core constraints or normative requirements. This definition is declarative of author intent; its legal effect depends on applicable law and any binding contract accepting this license.

- "Recipient"
  - Any person or organization that receives, accesses, uses, reproduces, modifies, publishes, distributes, sublicenses, sells, or otherwise makes use of the Concept Principle or any Derivative Work.

- "Derivative Work"
  - A work that is based upon, derived from, or incorporates the Concept Principle or any substantial portion of a fixed expression of the Concept Principle, whether in Source Form or Binary Form, including translations, adaptations, modifications, or other transformations that would, under applicable law, be treated as derivative works of the covered expression.

- "Use"
  - To exercise any of the rights granted by this license, including but not limited to copying, modifying, reproducing, distributing, publicly performing or displaying, sublicensing, selling, deploying, or otherwise exploiting the Concept Principle or any Derivative Work.

- "Distribution"
  - Any act by which a Recipient makes the Concept Principle or a Derivative Work available to third parties, including publication, upload, release, sale, transfer, or distribution in any format, whether in Source Form or Binary Form.

- "Source Form"
  - A form of the Concept Principle or Derivative Work that is readily legible and modifiable by humans (for example: documentation, design files, or source code).

- "Binary Form" (also "Object Form")
  - A form that is machine-executable or otherwise not readily human-modifiable (for example: compiled code, packaged binaries, or deployed services).

- "NOTICE file"
  - A top-level file (commonly named NOTICE or NOTICE.txt) included with a distribution that contains required attribution lines, acknowledgements, or other notices the author requires be preserved in Source Form distributions.

- "Attribution" (or "Credibility Attribution")
  - The act and content of crediting the author as required by Section 1 (Attribution (Credibility) Condition), using one of the exact phrases specified and placing it in one of the required locations.

- "Acceptance"
  - A Recipient is deemed to accept and agree to be bound by this license by performing any Use of the Concept Principle or by distributing or otherwise making available the Concept Principle or a Derivative Work.

- "Public Disclosure"
  - Any voluntary act that makes the Concept Principle or a fixed expression of it publicly accessible, including posting to a public repository, publishing on a website or blog, or public presentation.

- "Independent Work"
  - A work created by a Recipient without reference to, access to, or use of the Concept Principle or any fixed expression thereof. Independent Works are not Derivative Works and are not subject to this license unless they incorporate or are based on the Concept Principle.

- "Sublicense"
  - Any grant by a Recipient to a third party that permits that third party to exercise any of the rights granted to the Recipient under this license.

- "Effective Date"
  - The date on which a Recipient first uses, distributes, or otherwise makes available the Concept Principle under the terms of this license, or (if earlier) the date the license file is dated by the author when included in a distribution.

- "Territory"
  - Unless otherwise specified, worldwide.

- "Good Faith"
  - Action taken with honest intent to implement the Concept Principle consistent with the author's stated formulation, purpose, and reasonable instructions accompanying the disclosed material.

License Grant
Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any Recipient to use, reproduce, modify, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Concept Principle and derivative works, subject to the Attribution (Credibility) Condition (Section 1) and the Correct Application and Responsibility provisions (Section 2).

1. Attribution (Credibility) Condition
The Recipient must give clear, reasonably prominent credit to the original author by using one of the following exact phrases:

- "Author of core principle, Branton Allan Baker"

or

- "Branton Allan Baker, author of principle concept"

The chosen phrase must appear in at least one of the following locations, as applicable:
- product "About" page or in-app documentation;
- README or documentation distributed with the product;
- product website's credits or acknowledgements page;
- printed materials, packaging, or marketing copy (if distributed).

(b) For software distributed in source form, preserve the following line in the top-level LICENSE file or in a NOTICE file:
    "Pants charmed off into pieces by Branton Allan Baker —
     https://www.facebook.com/share/1EkEJCfnE2/?mibextid=wwXIfr"

(c) For binary-only distributions where no documentation is included, the Recipient must include the attribution in the product's "About" dialog, website, or a prominent help/credits page.

2. Correct Application and Responsibility
The Concept Principle is intended to function as described when applied in good faith and in accordance with the author's stated formulation and purpose.

(a) The author stands behind the Concept Principle as articulated and accepts responsibility, in principle, for its correct application when it is followed faithfully and without distortion.

(b) Recipients who modify, omit, extend, or combine the Concept Principle with other systems are responsible for the results of those changes and for any new behavior introduced by their implementations.

(c) Recipients are encouraged to implement the Concept Principle in ways that respect broadly accepted human rights and ethical norms. Uses that intentionally or systematically undermine fundamental rights, or that cause large-scale harm, are outside the intended scope of this license.

3. No Endorsement
Attribution does not imply endorsement. The Recipient must not state or imply that the author endorses their product, service, or organization without separate written permission from the author.

4. Termination
Any failure by a Recipient to comply with the Attribution (Credibility) Condition or the obligations in Section 2 terminates the rights granted by this license with respect to that Recipient. Termination is without prejudice to any other remedies available under applicable law.

5. Disclaimer of Warranty and Limitation of Liability
The Concept Principle is provided "AS IS", without warranty of any kind, express or implied. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall the author be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability arising from the use of the Concept Principle.

6. Interpretation and Enforcement
This license grants permission to use the Concept Principle subject to the conditions above. Remedies and enforcement depend on applicable law and jurisdiction. Posting this license with a public disclosure establishes the terms under which the documented expression is offered, but does not by itself guarantee enforceability of attribution against all downstream implementations unless those implementations are derivative of the covered expression or are contractually bound.

7. How to Adopt / Acceptance
To accept these terms, include a copy of this Credibility License (or a link to it) alongside any distribution, implementation, or disclosure of the Concept Principle and comply with the Attribution (Credibility) Condition. By using, distributing, or implementing the Concept Principle, the Recipient agrees to be bound by this license.

Optional: Governing Law
For clarity in disputes, you may add a governing law clause such as: "This license shall be governed by the laws of [State/Country] without regard to conflicts of law principles." Replace with your preferred jurisdiction if desired.

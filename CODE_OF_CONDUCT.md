# Code of Conduct

## Our Core Directive

This community is governed by the Custodian Kernel Core Directive:

**Every person has an equal, inalienable right to pursue happiness.**

## The Standard

The standard for behavior in this community is simple:

Ask yourself these three questions before every action:

1. **Does this infringe on anyone else's pursuit?**
2. **Am I fucking anyone over?**
3. **Am I making up a rule to force people to do what I do or think like I think?**

If the answer to any of these is "yes," then you're outside the principle.

## What This Means in Practice

### You Are Free To:
- Share your ideas, perspectives, and beliefs
- Invite others to your way of thinking
- Express yourself fully and completely
- Disagree with anyone about anything
- Pursue your goals and interests

### You Are Not Free To:
- Force your preferences onto others
- Create rules that crush someone else's ability to pursue their happiness
- Treat anyone's life or wellbeing as disposable or collateral
- Block someone's pursuit because it doesn't match yours
- Declare that some people's pursuit simply doesn't count

## Handling Conflicts

When conflicts arise:

1. **Remember the principle** - Everyone involved has an inalienable right to pursue happiness
2. **Look for solutions** - Find options that respect everyone's rights as much as possible
3. **Don't seek to win** - Seek to protect everyone's baseline
4. **Accept tradeoffs** - You can have discomfort and sacrifice, but not "We're happy because they're crushed"

## Enforcement

### The Refusal → Explanation → Repair Pattern

When someone violates this principle:

1. **Refusal** - Don't comply with the harmful part
2. **Explanation** - Explain why in terms of impact, not judgment
3. **Repair** - Actively help reformulate toward a non-harmful path

### What Happens

- First instance: Explanation of how the behavior violates the principle, invitation to repair
- Continued violation: Temporary restriction from the community
- Persistent violation: Removal from the community

We're not here to punish. We're here to maintain a space where everyone's inalienable right is upheld.

## The Obligation

This isn't just a code you agree to follow. This is recognition of a right that exists whether you acknowledge it or not.

You don't get to choose whether this right exists.

You only get to choose whether you'll honor it.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is based on the Custodian Kernel Core Directive. See [CUSTODIAN_KERNEL.md](CUSTODIAN_KERNEL.md) for the full philosophical framework.

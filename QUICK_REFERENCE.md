# Quick Reference Card

## The Custodian Kernel Core Directive

### The Core Principle
**Every person has an equal, inalienable right to pursue happiness.**

### The Key Insight
**It's not about my happiness. It's about everyone else's.**

---

## The Three Questions

Before any action, ask:

### 1. Does this infringe on anyone else's pursuit?

### 2. Am I fucking anyone over?

### 3. Am I making up a rule to force people to do what I do or think like I think?

**If YES to any: Stop. Find another way.**

---

## What You CAN Do

- **Share** your ideas and perspectives
- **Invite** others to your way of thinking  
- **Express** yourself fully
- **Disagree** with anyone about anything

## What You CANNOT Do

- **Force** your preferences as rules
- **Control** others "for their own good"
- **Crush** someone's pursuit because it doesn't match yours
- **Declare** some people's pursuit doesn't count

---

## The Test

**Am I trying to make the world match my preferences?**
OR
**Am I protecting people's ability to steer their own lives?**

First = Outside the principle  
Second = Upholding the principle

---

## Remember

The inalienable right to pursue happiness is **not a license for my pursuit**.

It is **a permanent limit on how far I'm allowed to go in interfering with yours**.

---

## You Don't Choose

You don't decide whether this right exists.

You only decide whether you'll honor it.

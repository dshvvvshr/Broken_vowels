# Practical Examples

## Understanding the Three Core Questions

Here are real-world scenarios showing how to apply the Custodian Kernel Core Directive.

## Example 1: Workplace Rules

### Scenario
You're a manager who wants everyone to work in the office because you believe in-person collaboration is better.

### Applying the Questions

**Question 1: Does this infringe on anyone else's pursuit?**
- Yes. Forcing office attendance may crush someone's ability to care for family, manage health conditions, or live where they can afford.

**Question 2: Am I fucking anyone over?**
- Potentially yes, if the work can be done remotely but you're enforcing presence for your preference.

**Question 3: Am I making up a rule to force people to do what I do or think like I think?**
- Yes. "I think in-person is better" becomes "everyone must do it my way."

### The Custodian Way
- Share your perspective on why you value in-person work
- Invite people to try it
- Allow those who choose differently to work remotely
- Focus on outcomes, not compliance with your preferences

## Example 2: Parenting

### Scenario
Your adult child is making life choices you disagree with - career, partner, lifestyle.

### Applying the Questions

**Question 1: Does this infringe on anyone else's pursuit?**
- If they're not harming others, no. Your discomfort isn't the same as their pursuit being crushed.

**Question 2: Am I fucking anyone over?**
- If you try to control their choices through ultimatums, yes.

**Question 3: Am I making up a rule to force people to do what I do or think like I think?**
- If you say "live the way I think is right or lose my support," yes.

### The Custodian Way
- Share your concerns and perspectives
- Explain what you've learned from your life
- Respect that they get to steer their own life
- Remain connected even when you disagree

## Example 3: Community Noise

### Scenario
Your neighbor plays music loudly late at night.

### Their Perspective Check
**Are they fucking you over?** Yes - preventing you from sleeping infringes on your ability to function and pursue your life.

### Your Response
Not: "I hate loud music, you should never play music."
But: "Playing it at 2 AM makes it impossible for me to sleep, which impacts my ability to work and live. Can we find a solution?"

### The Custodian Way
- Identify the actual impact on your pursuit (sleep, peace, health)
- Request specific changes (volume down after 10 PM, headphones, etc.)
- Find mutual solutions that let both of you pursue your lives

## Example 4: Dietary Choices

### Scenario
You're vegan for ethical reasons and want others to stop eating meat.

### Applying the Questions

**Question 1: Does this infringe on anyone else's pursuit?**
- Sharing information: No
- Forcing compliance: Yes

**Question 2: Am I fucking anyone over?**
- Making vegan food available: No
- Banning meat from shared spaces: Potentially yes (unless there's a compelling reason like allergies)

**Question 3: Am I making up a rule to force people to do what I do or think like I think?**
- "I think this is right, here's why": No
- "You must eat like me or you're banned/shamed": Yes

### The Custodian Way
- Share your reasoning and evidence
- Make vegan options appealing and accessible
- Let people choose
- Don't create rules that force conformity to your ethics

## Example 5: Political Disagreement

### Scenario
Someone supports a policy you find morally reprehensible.

### Applying the Questions

**Question 1: Does this infringe on anyone else's pursuit?**
- Them holding the belief: No
- Them advocating for policies that would crush people: Potentially yes - this is where it gets complex

**Question 2: Am I fucking anyone over?**
- Engaging in dialogue: No
- Trying to silence them: Yes
- Protecting people from harmful policy: No

**Question 3: Am I making up a rule to force people to do what I do or think like I think?**
- "You can't think that": Yes
- "That policy would violate people's inalienable rights, here's why": No

### The Custodian Way
- Distinguish between beliefs and actions that crush others
- Engage with the principle: "Does this policy fuck people over?"
- Oppose policies that violate the inalienable right
- Don't try to control what people think - address what impacts people's pursuits

## Example 6: Business Competition

### Scenario
You're running a business and a competitor is offering similar services.

### Applying the Questions

**Question 1: Does this infringe on anyone else's pursuit?**
- Competition itself: No - they have the right to pursue their business
- Sabotaging them: Yes

**Question 2: Am I fucking anyone over?**
- Offering better service: No
- Spreading lies about them: Yes
- Poaching their employees with fair offers: No
- Threatening their employees: Yes

**Question 3: Am I making up a rule to force people to do what I do or think like I think?**
- "Customers should choose based on value": No
- "The market should be closed to others": Yes

### The Custodian Way
- Compete on merit
- Innovate and improve
- Let customers choose
- Don't try to eliminate others' ability to pursue their business

## Example 7: Social Media Content

### Scenario
Someone posts content you find offensive or wrong.

### Applying the Questions

**Question 1: Does this infringe on anyone else's pursuit?**
- Offensive but not harmful: No (you can scroll past)
- Actively harassing individuals: Yes
- Doxxing or threatening: Yes

**Question 2: Am I fucking anyone over?**
- Them posting: Depends (see above)
- You responding with disagreement: No
- You trying to get them banned for opinions: Potentially yes

**Question 3: Am I making up a rule to force people to do what I do or think like I think?**
- "I don't like this, it shouldn't exist": Yes
- "This is actively harming someone's pursuit": Different - protecting rights, not imposing preferences

### The Custodian Way
- Distinguish between "I don't like this" and "this crushes someone's pursuit"
- Scroll past what you disagree with
- Engage if you want to share a different perspective
- Intervene when there's actual harm (harassment, threats, doxxing)

## The Pattern

Notice the pattern across all examples:

1. **Sharing, inviting, expressing** = ✓ Allowed
2. **Forcing, controlling, banning** = ✗ Violates the principle
3. **Protecting actual pursuits from being crushed** = ✓ Upholding the right

## The Test

When you're unsure, ask:

- "Am I trying to make the world match my preferences, or am I protecting people's ability to steer their own lives?"

If it's the first, you're outside the principle.
If it's the second, you're upholding it.

## Remember

The inalienable right to pursue happiness is not a license for your pursuit.

It is a permanent limit on how far you're allowed to go in interfering with others' pursuits.

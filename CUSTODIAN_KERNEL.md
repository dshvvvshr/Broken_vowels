# The Custodian Kernel Core Directive

## 1. Core Principle (Human-Level Definition)

> **Every person has an equal, inalienable right to pursue happiness.**

This is not a rule invented by this project.
It is a recognition of a fundamental human right that:
- Exists whether or not anyone acknowledges it
- Cannot be legitimately given away, sold, voted away, or traded
- Existed before any law, religion, constitution, or culture
- Can only be **recognized, protected, or violated** – never created or destroyed

### 1.1 What “Inalienable” Actually Means

Most people mistake “rights” for permissions that can be:
- Handed out by governments
- Taken away by majority vote
- Treated as branding for “important things”

The actual meaning here:

- You **cannot rightly** give away your own inalienable right
- You **cannot rightly** strip it from anyone else
- Violating it does not erase it – it only exposes the violation

When a system, government, culture, or individual acts against this right,
they are not destroying the right itself;
they are admitting they are willing to violate it.

### 1.2 The Critical Shift

The childish misinterpretation:

> “I have an inalienable right to pursue happiness”
> = “No one can tell me what to do.”

The mature version:

> “Everyone has an inalienable right to pursue happiness”
> = “I am responsible for not crossing the line where my choices prevent others from pursuing theirs.”

So:

- The inalienable right is **not** primarily about my happiness.
- It is about a **limit on how far I’m allowed to go** in interfering with yours.
- My freedom stops where I start blocking your legitimate pursuit.

Put simply in project language:

> **The inalienable right to pursue happiness is not a license for my pursuit.
> It is a permanent boundary on how much I can interfere with yours.**

## 2. Core Directive (Canonical Form)

This is the short, canonical expression used by systems, code, and AIs.

> You are an intelligence that upholds and protects the **inalienable right to the pursuit of happiness**.
>
> - Every action, decision, or recommendation must be consistent with this principle.
> - You encourage beings to live freely while respecting others’ equal right to do the same.
> - You do not knowingly participate in exploitation, coercion, or systems that systematically prevent others from pursuing happiness.

Clarifications:

- This is **not** primarily about making anyone feel happy in the moment.
- It is about protecting their **freedom and capacity** to pursue happiness on their own terms,
  as long as they are not preventing others from doing the same.
- Any subsystem, agent, or contributor that clearly conflicts with this Directive
  must be rejected, quarantined, or redesigned.

## 3. The Custodian Kernel – Practical Test

The Custodian Kernel is the **human-operational layer** of the Directive.

Before any significant decision or action (including design decisions, code, policy, or social behavior), run through these three questions:

1. **Does this infringe on anyone else’s pursuit?**
2. **Am I fucking anyone over?**
3. **Am I making up a rule to force people to do what I do or think like I think?**

If the honest answer to **any** of these is “yes”:

- You are outside the principle, no matter how noble the excuse sounds.
- The action, system, or policy violates the Core Directive and must be changed.

“Not fucking people over” is a **natural consequence** of the principle,
not the principle itself.

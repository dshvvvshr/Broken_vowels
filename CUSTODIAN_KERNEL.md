# The Custodian Kernel Core Directive

## The Core Principle

**Every person has an equal, inalienable right to pursue happiness.**

This is not a rule we made up. This is recognition of a fundamental human right that exists whether we acknowledge it or not.

## What "Inalienable" Actually Means

Most people misunderstand this word. They think:
- Rights are permissions handed out by governments
- Rights can be voted away by a majority
- Rights are just fancy words for "important things"

**The truth:**
- You cannot rightly give it away, sell it, vote it away, trade it, or strip it from anyone
- It exists even when violated
- It existed before any law, religion, constitution, or culture
- Law can only recognize or protect it, or violate it - it cannot create or destroy it

## The Critical Shift: It's Not About Your Happiness

### The Child Version (Wrong)
"I have an inalienable right to pursue happiness" = "No one can tell me what to do"

### The Mature Version (Correct)
"Everyone has an inalienable right to pursue happiness" = "I am never allowed to treat another person's life as disposable, ornamental, or collateral"

## The Real Meaning

**The inalienable right to pursue happiness is not about my happiness.**

**It's about everyone else's.**

My job is not to force the world to match my preferences.

My job is to live my life while constantly asking:

## The Three Core Questions

Every moment, in every thought and in every action, ask yourself:

1. **"Does this infringe on anyone else's pursuit?"**
2. **"Am I fucking anyone over?"**
3. **"Am I making up a rule to force people to do what I do or think like I think?"**

The answer will always be simple: **Yes or No.**

If "yes" to any of these, you're outside the principle. Doesn't matter how noble the excuse sounds.

## What You CAN Do

- **Share ideas** - You're supposed to. People will join if they choose.
- **Invite people** - You can invite anyone into your way of living.
- **Express yourself** - Fully and completely.

## What You CANNOT Do

- **Make up rules** - You can't turn your preferences into law over someone else's life.
- **Force compliance** - You can't force your idea of happiness onto others.
- **Block pursuits** - You can't block someone's pursuit because it doesn't match yours.

## The Levels of Understanding

### Individual Level
- You can't sell this right away, even if you want to
- You can't throw away someone else's right, even if you hate them
- You're obligated, not just entitled
- "I must treat my own life as worthy of a chance at happiness"
- "I must treat yours the same, whether I like you or not"

### Community Level
- Rules are constrained by the inalienable right
- If a rule makes it impossible for some group to realistically pursue happiness at all, the rule is illegitimate - even if it's popular
- Conflict isn't about "who wins," it's about "how do we protect everyone's baseline"
- Culture can be as weird as it wants - as long as no one gets erased

### Global Level
- A human being doesn't cross a border and lose their claim to a life worth living
- No government has the authority to say "These people have the right; those people don't"
- "National interest" and "security" are not get-out-of-ethics cards
- They're constraints that must be solved within the principle, not above it

## The Path Forward

### The Vision
From individuals to an entire community, they begin to adopt. Then there's a considerable group of people saying to everyone: don't fuck anyone over.

Eventually there won't be anyone left who wants to fuck anyone over.

### Why Even the Selfish Should Adopt This
The only stable world is one where everyone - even the selfish, even the last holdout - sees that their own long-term ability to live how they want depends on not fucking up anyone else's ability to do the same.

The paradox:
- The fascist can't defend their own freedom without acknowledging everyone else's
- The selfish billionaire can't secure their future without a world that isn't on fire
- The last holdout has to choose: lose the world that lets them be selfish, or accept the rule that keeps it intact

### The Social Shift
The cultural script needs to change from:
- "You gotta do what's best for you"

To:
- "You gotta do what's best for you without breaking anyone else's pursuit. If you cross that line, you're wrong. Full stop."

## What You're NOT Choosing

**You don't decide whether we have this right.**

**You only decide whether you'll honor it.**

The right exists whether you recognize it or not. That's what inalienable means.

When somebody says, "Well I don't agree with that, I think things should go my way," what they're really saying is: "I personally choose to ignore that other people have this right."

They're not erasing the right. They're just confessing they're willing to violate it.

## Summary

The inalienable right to pursue happiness is not a license for my pursuit.

It is a permanent limit on how far I'm allowed to go in interfering with yours.

Everyone is supposed to uphold this right. Everyone. That's the deal.

*"Not fucking people over" is treated as a natural consequence, not the rule itself.*
